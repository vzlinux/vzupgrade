vzupgrade tool can be used to upgrade VHS 7 to 8 and CentOS 7 to VzLinux 8.

Normally, the vzupgrade script should be installed via the RPM package from VzLinux repos:

```sh
 yum install -y yum-utils
 yum-config-manager --add-repo http://repo.virtuozzo.com/vzlinux/7/x86_64/os/
 yum install -y --nogpgcheck vzupgrade
```

Make sure to disable the VzLinux repo before real upgrade

```sh
 rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/repo.virtuozzo*
```

Before running vzupgrade, install all CentOS updates:

```sh
 yum update -y
```

Now run the pre-upgrade check, for CentOS one should use "--skip-vz" option:

```sh
 vzupgrade check --skip-vz
```

If no problems were found, run the upgrade itself:

```sh
 vzupgrade install --skip-vz
```

The system will be rebooted into a special mode (using "Upgrade-initramfs" initrd image).
One can specify --reboot option to make this reboot happen automatically.

Once the upgrade is finished, the system will be automatically rebooted once again
into upgraded system.

**Pre-check and pre-upgrade hooks**

The tool supports launching custom scripts before the check and before the upgrade phases.
All executable files found inside the **/usr/share/vzupgrade/pre-check** folder will be launched
just before the check, and all executable files found inside the **/usr/share/vzupgrade/pre-install**
folder will be launched just before the upgrade stage starts.

Note that we don't expect these custom scripts to print anything on the screen. They should use
their own log files if needed.

Also make sure that it is possible that user will launch 'check' or 'install' multiple times.
The custom scripts should be ready for this.
